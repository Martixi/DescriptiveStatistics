## Your turn!

Your task this week is to: prepare your own descriptive analysis for the
"CreditCard" dataset (AER package). It is a cross-sectional dataframe on
the credit history for a sample of applicants for a type of credit card.

ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income -
significantly different for applicants for customers with different
credit risk ("card" variable - factor)?

Prepare a professional data visualizations, descriptive statistics'
tables and interpret them.
